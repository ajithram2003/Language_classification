# Language Classification using Multinomial Naive Bayes



**Overview**

This project focuses on classifying text data into different languages using a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the "Language Detection" dataset. The implemented solution involves preprocessing the text data, transforming it into a bag-of-words model, and training a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for language prediction.

**Data**

The dataset used (Language Detection.csv) contains text samples labeled with their corresponding languages. The languages are the target classes for the classification task.


**Dependencies**

- Pandas: Data manipulation library
- NumPy: Numerical operations library
- Regular Expressions (re): Text pattern matching and manipulation
- Seaborn and Matplotlib: Data visualization libraries
